## Project Description:

This is a simple API for a Cinema Booking System built using Django. It allows users to manage cinema bookings, movies, and related entities.

# Cinema Booking API

This project is a Cinema Booking System API built with Django REST Framework as registered in settings.py.
It supports CRUD operations for Movies, Cinema Halls, Shows, Customers, and Bookings.

## 1. Project Implementation

### Models and Relationships

# Movie Model

- Fields: `title`, `description`, `duration`, `release_date`.
- Relationships: A `Show` is associated with a `Movie`.

# CinemaHall Model

- Fields: `name`, `capacity`.
- Relationships: A `Show` is associated with a `CinemaHall`.

# Show Model

- Fields: `movie`, `cinema_hall`, `start_time`, `end_time`.
- Relationships: References a `Movie` and a `CinemaHall`.

# Customer Model

- Fields: `name`, `email`.
- Relationships: A `Booking` is associated with a `Customer`.

# Booking Model

- Relationships: References a `Show` and a `Customer`.

### Views/ViewSets and Their Roles

# MovieViewSet

### Serializers and Validation Rules

# MovieSerializer

# CinemaHallSerializer

- Validates that `capacity` is a positive integer.

# ShowSerializer:

- Validates that `start_time` is earlier than `end_time`.

# CustomerSerializer

- Ensures `email` follows a valid email format.

# BookingSerializer

- Validates that the number of `seats` booked does not exceed the available seats for a show.

2. # Tests Conducted
   # 2.1 Postman Testing

- Endpoints tested for Movies, Cinema Halls, Shows, Customers, and Bookings.
- Each endpoint supports: RUD operations
